This program showcases the use of creating a custom module and applying it to the user's requirement.

With the help of this program, we can co-relate python with topics of different branches.

For example, here, in this program the topic 'FIN', of the subject 'HMT- Heat and Mass Transfer', has been significantly used in python programming to solve various problems related to the subjected topic.

By creating this custom module, I am able to learn and understand the concept of module and packages. Moreover, the challenges which occurred during the programming phase of this project helped me to develop my problem solving skills and learn more about python libraries in depth.

This program solves various problems based on fins and its different cases.
